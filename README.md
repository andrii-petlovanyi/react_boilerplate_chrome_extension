Hey hey...

Thank you for choosing my custom React.JS boilerplate for creating an awesome Chrome extension. This boilerplate comes with two examples that show you how to create a popup from the browser toolbar and inject a small app into a Google (or any other) page.

To get started, follow the steps below:

- Clone this repository onto your machine.
- Install all the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:
<div align="start">
  <pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
</div>

- Once the packages are installed, start the development server by running the following command in your terminal:
<div align="start">
  <pre><code>npm run dev</code></pre>
</div>

- After building the project, go to Chrome Settings using the three dots on the top right corner.

- Enable developer mode.

- Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the "dist" folder in the project's directory.
 Congratulations! You can now see your extension in action.
 
If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please feel free to create an issue on this repository.

Happy coding!

With love, Andrii P.
